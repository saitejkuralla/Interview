1. Difference between Object and Dynamic ?
	Difference 1: 
		object : compiler has little information for object type. Its not type safe
		object a = "Bhuvan Ram"
		string s = a; // Gives error as we need to explicit typecasting

		dynamic : compiler doesnt have any information about the variable
		dynamic a = "Bhuvan Ram"
		string s =a; // No Error

	Difference 2:
		Object : Introduced in C# 1.0
		dynamic : Introduced in C# 4.0

	Difference 3:
		Object : we need to the casting explicitly every time.
		dynamic : no need of explicit casting
